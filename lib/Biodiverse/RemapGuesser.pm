=head1 NAME

Biodiverse::RemapGuesser

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Generate remappings between slightly different sets of
strings. (e.g. labels for a newly imported tree and existing
basedata).

=head1 DESCRIPTION

There are four stages of matching. After each stage, any string that
was matched is removed. The next step runs only on the remaining
unmatched strings. 

The first stage looks for exact matches between the two sets of
strings. The second stage looks for strings differing only by
punctuation. This is done by removing all punctuation and finding
exact matches in this 'punctuation-less' state. The third stage looks
for matches which are within a specified edit distance. For example,
if the edit distance specified was 1, then Tyypo would match Typo but
not Tyyypo. The fourth and final stage places all remaining unmatched
labels into the 'not matched category'.

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item C<new>

Standard constructor for the RemapGuesser class.

=item C<perform_auto_remap>

Given a hash and a 'data source' (anything which implements
C<remap_labels_from_hash>, normally a C<BaseData>, C<Tree> or
C<Matrix>). The hash maps from the names of labels already in the data
source to the desired new label names. The data source's labels are
renamed according to the hash. e.g. The hash might contain Genus_sp1
=> GenusSp1. If there is a label named Genus_sp1 in the data source,
it will be renamed to GenusSp1.

=item C<generate_auto_remap>

Given two data sources (anything implementing C<get_labels()>), and a
number of configuration options, generates a hash mapping the labels
of one data source to the other. 

The C<first_source> argument is mapped to the C<second_source>
argument. The C<max_distance> argument controls the maximum acceptable
edit distance for two labels to be regarded as a match. (see class
description for explanation of matching process). The C<ignore_case>
argument specifying whether case is treated as punctuation. For
example, if this is true, GenusSp will match genussp in the
punctuation stage. This avoids the edit distance requirement which
would prevent case errors from being matched.

C<generate_auto_remap> returns a hash. C<remap> is a hash specifying
the complete mapping that was found. This can be passed into
C<perform_auto_remap> to actually carry out a remap. C<exact_matches>,
C<punct_matches>, C<typo_matches> and C<not_matched> are lists of
labels which were matched in the four stages of matching. (see class
description).

=item C<no_punct>

Given a string (C<args{str}>), returns it with no
punctuation. Anything outside the Perl \d and \w classes are
removed. Additionally, quotes and underscores are removed. If
C<args{ignore_case}> is true, the string is also converted to
lowercase.

=item C<guess_remap>

Given two lists of strings, generates a remap hash from the first to
the second using the four stage process described in the class
description section. Usually outside callers should use
generate_auto_remap instead of calling this function directly.
